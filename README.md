# About

Performed a survey in my college which included questions similar to those asked in a personality quiz, related to pop-culture and more. I used the responses as parameters to then create a mapping of all the participants in a 2-d plane using Self-Organising Map.

# Applications

1. Can be used while alloting hostel rooms to new college students.
