# SOM
Self-Organising Map(SOM) is a type of Artificial Neural Network able to convert complex, nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional data items into simple geometric relationships on a low-dimensional display.
MiniSom is a minimalistic and Numpy based implementation of the SOM, https://github.com/JustGlowing/minisom under the license CC BY 3.0

# About

In a college project, I conducted a survey among participants with questions designed to resemble those found in personality quizzes, covering various aspects including pop culture preferences and personal interests. Using the survey responses, I employed a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to visualize and analyze the data.

# Methodology

1. Survey Design: The survey was crafted to capture a wide range of personality traits and preferences.
2. Data Collection: Responses were gathered from college participants.
3. Data Processing: I applied Self-Organizing Maps, a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to process the survey data.

# Results

The SOM produced a 2-dimensional map where each participant was represented as a point in the plane. The mapping revealed that participants who were positioned closer to each other on the map exhibited similar personality traits as determined by the survey. This spatial arrangement allowed for an intuitive understanding of the relationships between different personality profiles within the participant group.

# Conclusion

The project demonstrated the effectiveness of Self-Organizing Maps in clustering and visualizing complex personality data, providing insights into how similar or different participants are based on their responses. This approach offers a unique way to understand and represent personality similarities in a visually accessible format.
